"How often to wash thin hair?I have pretty thin hair and I sweat a LOT especially from my scalp (gross, I know). So many people tell me not to wash your hair every day, and it will train itself to not be greasy. But, again, I sweat a LOT, especially in the summer. I feel gross if I don‚Äôt wash my hair in the shower, and it looks terrible if I don‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm curious if simply rinsing it would be ok? Would just rinsing my hair off in the shower clean it of the sweat, without weighing it down with product?",femalehairadvice

"Distraught about haircut (what should I do?)I have really thick wavy hair that gets golden in the sun. I love my hair. I think it is my favorite physical feature about myself. I went to great clips today to get it cut, and I don't know much about hair styling because my friend usually cuts my hair at home. The stylist and I agreed to cut off two inches with layers. I just went with her recommendation with what would look good. Part way through the haircut, she started with these shears, and I asked her what they were for, and she said 'thinning' out the hair. I had this done when I was a kid, and disliked it. Had she told me or asked me if I wanted my hair thinned out, I would have said no. I didn't tell her to stop, because she had already started, and I was like no use now, cause it will be lopsided cause she already started. But I regret that because she ended up taking so much off. I don't know enough about hairdressing enough to know if the thinning is implied in the layers, but I feel very mislead. She thinned so far close to the top of my hair, that it is going to take so long to grow back. I hate reaching back to my ponytail because I miss all the hair I used to feel and I just feel like crying. I feel like I am over dramatic and maybe I'm being petty, but I am really feeling hurt and mislead. I walked out of the salon, and ran my hands through my hair and was like what the crap (its a few hours later now). Is it a Karen or asshole move for me to ask great clips for my money back on this haircut? I'm willing to accept its my fault for not clarifying what layering means, but if its not, I would like to know. Thank you!",femalehairadvice

"Silicone build-up in hair? Help please!So I went to my local hair salon recently to get a new colour. They told me had a lot of silicone build-up in my hair. They even told me to come back in 6 weeks time because the dye likely wouldn't take to my hair due to the build-up. They said it's because of the shampoo I had been using (Pantene). I've now switched to OGX Charcoal Purifying detox shampoo and conditioner but how do I know its working?

"Enhancing red hairHi,

I want to enhance my naturally red-ish hair. I was a true ginger as a kid all up to beginning college. My hair started getting darker and sometimes I don't feel like redhead anymore. And anyone who is a redhead knows that is a real crisis. I was always the ginger friend.

I have never dyed my hair. It's currently a dark strawberry blond with almost mousey brown roots. There still is a hint of ginger, but not quite. I don't know how to describe it because it is very different on daylight, in golden hour, under an artificial light...I would like to enhance it a little bit. I am not looking to go full ginger as my hair is not that anymore, but I want to fell a little more like my old self.

What should I look for in a salon? Do you think I will have to bleach some of it. Should I do only some highlights?

Thanks for all the advice",femalehairadvice
"Need Some Advice to Get Curls to Stay for My Wedding!!Hello! This is my first time posting in this sub but I am hoping I can get some good information :)

I have fine hair (but quite a bit of it) and it is fairly long (about chest length). I am curling my own hair for the wedding as we are getting married in a fairly secluded spot and I can't have a hairdresser come to the site.

I currently curl my hair with a 1inch hot tools marcel iron for a loose curl with, and I am quite comfortable doing so - but I find my hair style just does not last long enough - especially since we will be getting married outside. 

I was considering trying out a curling wand as I have heard great things about them on here - but would love any tips you guys have for tools, product etc. that you think would help my curls stay!

"How damaged does my hair look to you? ft. more questions about going back to dark brown from pink at home (pic inside)[This is my hair as of last night](https://i.imgur.com/uPpvGPC.jpg). I kept the size and coloring how they originally were so you could get the best idea of color and hair quality. I usually bleach with L'oreal Quick Blue Bleach + developer, and then dye over it with Manic Panic's Hot Hot Pink (or, previously, Atomic Pink by Special Effects).   

How damaged does my hair look to you? I honestly can't tell and I'd really like some objective opinions.. I know it's not completely fried but I'm trying to see how much nicer my hair will feel once my raw/virgin hair grows out.  

I'd also like some advice on going back to dark brown from this shade at home ‚Äî I plan to go to Sally's for the supplies:  

1. Do I need to 'fill' the hair first with [something red](https://www.sallybeauty.com/just-ask-sally/sally-favorites/10-red-red-colorful-protein-filler/SBS-636305.html) (or [brown](https://www.sallybeauty.com/just-ask-sally/sally-favorites/2-warm-brown-protein-filler/SBS-636302.html)?) or is the pink good enough?  
2. How do I color match my roots as closely as possible?  
3. Is there any reliable way to use a couple different brown dyes to add some kind of dimension/color melt at home (ie so it's not one flat shade)?
3. Other than gloves and a brush, what supplies do I need? I am only used to bleaching &gt; dying it pink, not dying it darker afterwards.  
4. Are there any guides or tutorials online that you recommend?  

Thanks in advance! xo",femalehairadvice
"The salon f*cked my hair up:(I wanted to bleach the under layer of my hair as well as the front pieces, but the under layer turned out soooo orange!! The front was fine but I walked out the salon with two different tones in my hair [tiktok here](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMdfyUbyt/)

The front was so light because they used foils but they didn‚Äôt use any for the underneath part üò°

I want to get it lighter so I ordered some supplies (30v developer, bleach, t10 toner with 20v developer). Do you advise I should lighten my hair again, hoping the orange bit lifts to the same lightness as the front or should I return my supplies and colour the orange bit dark brown, like it was before?

"Shedding Light on Ideal Hair Loss Treatment and Re-growth OptionHair loss depends on the dihydrotestosterone (DHT) hormone in the body. Low-level laser therapy includes emitting of photons on the scalp that further leads to the production of adenosine triphosphate. It is believed to increase blood flow and stimulate metabolism in hair follicles. The excessive build-up of DHT hormone is also prevented. Hence, laser hair loss treatment and regrowth therapy result in the production of natural hair follicles.

As laser therapy has no burns or scars after treatment as compared to the wounds of hair transplants.

Couple months ago, I got my hair bleached and asked her to dye/tone it as silver as possible, and that also ended up fading to a brownish blonde really fast as well. 

Will ashy colors always turn blonde?

"I need a new hairstyle! Can you help me?Dear community, I am really stuck with what haircut to get next. I am really open to any type of suggestions. I didn't include pictures of me having long hair because it looks ridiculous on me. My face shape is somewhat squarish and round. I am quite tall 5.8/175cm tall and skinny (if that helps lol). The shaggy hair looks good in my opinion, but usually, every hairstyle tends to just go flat on me one day after washing :( Hope these reference photos can help.

"Going back to naturalHi everyone,  I decided I want to stop dying my hair after going back to my natural color. My hair was bleach blonde at the very beggining of the month. Then a few days into the month I dyed it blue. I decide I didn't like the blue earlier this week and tried to go back to my natural color. I bleached it and put light brown dye over it and it turned green. So then I put on a red color to hopefully cancel out the green and it was purple. So after all of that, yesterday I just gave in and dyed it dark brown. Right now it's a dark brown/ purple shade. I really want to still go back to my natural color. Obviously I will wait a little while because my hair is starting to show signs of damage. But how can I go to my natural color from here? If I fade the dark brown will it become light brown, or just turn greenish again because of the blue under it? Even if I did manage to get it light enough to dye it light brown, would it fade back to green? I'm willing to go to a professional but would rather do it at home.

"27F Hairless patches on sides of hairline - is this receding hair?Hello! I am 27 years old and have very thick, curly hair. I have a short haircut with ""baby bangs."" I never pull my hair back, but today I pushed it away from my face for a moment and noticed that I have wide patches along the sides of my hairline where there is virtually no hair. I never noticed this before, but I never pull my hair back, so I haven't really looked at that area of hairline. Is this normal, or is this a receding hairline? I'm not sure if it's something I should address with a doctor.

"What am I doing wrong?I did not grow up having long hair and so I did not learn how to do fun and pretty things. My hair was often shaved off once it got passed my ears, so taking care of it was never a thing I had to worry about. As an adult I like my hair long. It's been a struggle learning how to take care of curls, how to braid it, how to enhance the curl pattern, ect. but I love it all...all except what to use when I (rarely) choose to wear it straight. 

I have tried everything to have smooth and beautiful hair, even switching flat irons because I thought that could be the problem. I've concluded that I am using heat protectant incorrectly.  I've watched videos, I've used the products recommended; my hair always ends up feeling disgusting.  It's dry while also feeling a bit greasy, it ends up looking like I haven't washed my hair in ages even if I'm fresh out of the shower. I have even tried skipping using my hair oil, thinking that was the culprit. The texture is awful and there is a distinct smell (my boyfriend says it doesn't, but I can smell it). It doesn't smell like burnt hair. I don't even know how to describe it. I end up having to clean my iron every time because it gets this wax like substance on the sides I can only assume comes from the heat protectant. Am I using too much? Is my heat too high or low? What am I doing wrong?

I don't mind it growing out a decent amount, but I do mind how the color fades (and toner always fades super quickly for me). I've tried the purple/blue shampoos and they dont do much. My question is, is it possible for a hairstylist to put permanent (or even semi-perm) hair dye color over the parts that get bleaches for balayage instead of toner so the color will last longer?

Shea moisture causing hair lossI switched to Shea moisture shampoo and conditioner months ago and notice that it cause me more hair loss. I was already dealing with hair loss. Before that I was using dove products since that‚Äôs what my mom buys for the household. I stopped the dove stuff because of the ‚Äúbad chemicals‚Äù all these shampoo companies were adding. I don‚Äôt know what to do can anyone recommend me affordable shampoos and conditioners free of harmful chemicals that can cause cancer and damage hair. My hair type I would say is wavy but it‚Äôs a bit damaged and also has color in it. I also have not seen any benefits to my hair from using Shea moisture. I used their coconut curl and shine and the manuka conditioner. The shampoo doesn‚Äôt even wash my hair properly or lather/make foam unless I use an insanely large amount. Which kind of makes me wonder if they do this to their formula on purpose so you can go through a bottle quicker and spend more $$$. It would make sense. My hair type would be a between 2a and 2b but right now it‚Äôs leaning more towards 2a since it‚Äôs damaged.,femalehairadvice

Will it help it to not become further damaged if I only trim off an inch or two, or do I need to get the bulk of the bleached hair? 


I prefer long hair (partially because I am plus size and have a big double chin), but would rather do a big chop once and get it over with if needed, rather than trim a few inches and realize the damage is continuing.

"In Need of Advice- Hair Dye Failure, Attempt at red hair gone bad :'(Hi everyone! Sorry this is my first post here, but I dyed my hair red today with Garnier box dye in the shade Goji Berry (i know, box dye &lt;/3) and it came out a very nasty color- dark red mixed with shades of orange, copper, and dark brown. My natural color is a very dark brown (nearly black), but within the past year I got my hair bleached by a friend, dyed forest green, and then dyed dark pink (both of those with Manic Panic).

I know- that's a lot to put my hair through. Despite this, it actually is very healthy! I have thin wavy hair, so I moisturize it greatly so that it will be soft and healthy still. After I dyed my hair pink, I used Garnier box dye to dye it dark brown, and it faded into a light brown. Since it faded so much, I figured that maybe I could dye it dark red, as I had seen some people with darker hair color use the Goji Berry shade and achieve the dark red I wanted. This did not work, however. My hair now has multiple shades that are not close to the dark red I wanted, does anyone have any advice so as to what to do? I was thinking of redying my hair with the same shade or perhaps a darker red. Thank you all so much in advance!",femalehairadvice
