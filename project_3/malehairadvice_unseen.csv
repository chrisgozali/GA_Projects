"Are there any oils that also hold hair?My hair is thick, dry, and low porosity.

I want to grow it out and slick it back.

 If I try to put any kind of pomade or gel in it, it just soaks it right up. It holds the shape, more or less, but it doesn't give that slicked back and combed type of look that I want. Instead it looks dry and frizzy.

If I just use a little coconut oil or argan oil, it finally doesn't look dry, but it won't hold itself backwards and loses its shape throughout the day.

Is there a product that does both? 

(Combining both products ends up dry as well)",malehairadvice

"LPT: Own your hairI see a whole lot of posts on /r/malehairadvice. A whole lot. And I got some stuff to say.

First: Own it. Own your hair. It’s your hair. It’s always going to be your hair. Own it.

Second: I’ve been drinking.

Third: If you’re worried about going bald, then let me be the first, second, or last person to tell you that it doesn’t matter. Chicks don’t care if you’re bald. Guys don’t care if you’re bald. And if for some god awful reason they do, they’re not worth it. Their opinions literally don’t matter.

Fourth: If you’re asking what to do with your hair, first consider your head. If your hair is thin, there is only so much that can be done. Own it. (See item one.) If you’re hair is long and full and you’re not sure, you can do a few things: sculpt it however you feel is best, or cut it all off and donate it to some unfortunate soul who is going through alopecia or chemotherapy and whose morale could really be bolstered by having a human-hair wig. Not a joke. It could really make someone’s day.

Fifth: Ask your peers. If you go ask people your age, who see you on a regular basis, you may get a billion opinions, in which case you should choose whatever you feel would best suit you… and if you later feel it doesn’t, then try something different. 

Sixth: If you have no one to talk to about it, then choose the most boring normal haircut: short sides, medium top. Why choose that? Because it’s a classic look that works for every guy. Every. Fricking. Guy. Even the bald ones.

Seventh: There isn’t a name for every hairstyle. Guys don’t typically name their haircuts. Sure, there are a few. But generally dudes do what they feel like. They cut their hair “short,” they “grow it out,” they “fade” the sides, they shave their sides and spike the remaining strip and call it a “mohawk” like the American Indian tribe. It’s not a name. It’s a thing. 

Eighth: Just fricking do it. If you don’t like it, it’s fine. It’ll grow back in a few months. And if it works out great, then folks will notice and compliment it.

Ninth: If someone (man, woman, dog, cat, non-binary) gives you crap about your hair, make them eat their words. Tell them you got their idea from their mom’s short and curlies. That their mom’s bush was so breathtaking that you were inspired. The way it swayed in the wind. The way it wrapped directly into their butt hair. And that the moment you saw it you had to honor it. Because everyone else can eat it. And you can fix your hair later.

Finally: Just fricking own it.",malehairadvice

"Balding/thinning? Should I get medications?Hi everyone,

I have an appointment with a dermatologist coming up and I was hoping to get some advice on my hair. I have always had a very high hairline, but now I've been wondering if there is some thinning going on too. I have mild seb derm which causes flakiness. I notice a decent amount of hair coming out in the shower, but I've also been very stressed recently and the seb derm seems to irritate the scalp.

Do you think this could be the beginning stages of male pattern baldness? Do you recommend medications?

I'm not sure if the back is thinning or just a cowlick. My hair also ""clumps"" together. My current routine is T-gel for seb derm alternating with head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner. I have greasy and oily hair.

I appreciate any advice!

When I wash it, it looks like a have a terrible mushroom cut, feels really dry, doesn't have layers to it and just doesn't fit with my beard/manly exterior lol. It can't be styled unless I use like half a tub of pomade or something.... But when I go 3-5 days with no wash, my hair can be styled, it looks healthy, and doesn't move around, easier to take care of etc etc etc.

I've tried watering down my shampoo, that didn't work... and I heard that dry shampoo is not healthy for your hair, so I try not to use that often...

Clearly the lack of natural oils here is what is causing my hair to have issues. Are there any products out there, that can clean my hair, but not remove the oils so that I can keep styling it as I normally would be able to if I didn't wash it?

"How to deal with short, super stiff hair?My hairdresser says I have the stiffest hair she's ever seen. I've been using shampoo with urea and cocoa butter along with conditioner to try to combat this but there was little effect. My hair did get softer, but it's still stiff. Whenever I try to sweep it to one side, it falls straight down after a while - both the sides and front. I usually try to keep it short, but not super short, so it nearly covers my eye if I let it fall. Because it's so stiff it makes it hard to apply anything to it - gels, paste. In fact, only those mattifying powders seem to do anything (unfortunately they leave residue on my hair the next day, even if I wash it off). Those are the only products I've tried so far.

Anyone else have experiences with this? Is there anything I can do to actually make my hair less stiff? Or is it best to just deal with it? For context, I'd really like to have messy hair.",malehairadvice

My hair is very thick, which might be part of the issue. Are there any other products I should try?

"Could use some help in how to ask for a haircut[https://imgur.com/a/RmBOq6Z](https://imgur.com/a/RmBOq6Z)

Hello, first time poster here. I'll try to give some background: I recently moved to Canada from Mexico, so I'm unfamiliar with any english terms and I don't even know how to ask for a haircut. One thing I usually asked for was to get a layered cut so the front would look natural, but I'm not even sure if that's the right term (in Mexico we called it ""degrafilado"").

As for what I'm going for...well, my hair is as stubborn as it gets (straight hair that has been described as a final exam for stylists), so most of my life I've just focused on how to ask for a haircut that doesn't look like a bowl cut while being short enough to not poke my eyes.

I warm it in my hands for around 10 seconds roughly and then start from the back fling side to side and then take my hands from the front to back and then style.

"How can I get/What should I do to get Syd Barrett's hairstyle?Hello! All my life I have had semi-curly, mostly wavy long brown hair but it's usually been very frizzy and big whenever I've brushed it, and stringy uncomfortable curls when I've let it air dry all the way. It would also naturally form to look like a mushroom where it was flat on the top but full on the sides, and also was flat at the back of my head (you can probably imagine how stupid I look..) I'm looking to achieve a sort of curly, semi-frizzy, all around voluminous hairstyle similar to Syd Barrett in the 60's. For references, here are some pictures: [https://imgur.com/a/OgkbMGU](https://imgur.com/a/OgkbMGU) (after the fourth or so image I also attached some examples of my hair for comparison)  


My usual routine is right after I shower, I apply [Kroger-brand curl mousse](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kroger.com%2Fp%2Fproduct%2F0060308426020&amp;psig=AOvVaw37q0Ig0UPqISY0XAws3AB9&amp;ust=1624214159177000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAsQjhxqFwoTCKj4grKrpPECFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) and let my hair air dry for about 20-30 minutes, and then I'll take a blow dryer and lightly dry the entirety of my hair on the lowest setting while moving it around with my hand. In the past, I would literally just take a towel and go to town by rustling my hair with it but I realized that's not very efficient (or good for your hair), so I've since stopped.
