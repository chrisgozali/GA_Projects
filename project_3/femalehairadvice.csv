"Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è About BiotinI got bloodwork done recently and my thyroid levels were abnormal; it came back indicative of hyperthyroidism.  This was a bit of a shock to me as I had just gotten my bloodwork done about 8 months ago and was completely normal.  Also it was my TSH that was abnormal, but my T3 and T4 levels were normal.  I was mentally preparing myself to go through the motions of medication, etc when I thought back to what changed in the past 8 months.  It just didn‚Äôt make sense to me that it could change that fast, and the fact that T3 and T4 were normal but TSH not.  

Anyway, I determined the change within the last 8 months was me starting to take 10,000mcg biotin for hair growth.  I researched it and I found out that biotin can in fact alter your thyroid blood work results; particularly your TSH with normal T3 and T4 levels.  I told my doctor about this and he agreed I go off the biotin and redo my bloodwork in 4 weeks.  I got it done again and yep- all came back normal again. 

Needless to say I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm fine and don‚Äôt have hyperthyroidism, but if I hadn‚Äôt had researched and found out about the biotin, I may have been put on medication for a disease I don‚Äôt even have. 

*Also, spoiler alert üö® I measured my hair growth throughout the whole time of taking biotin and my hair grew 0.5‚Äù per month, which is the same as it always was prior to biotin.  It did not work at all.*

**TL; dr** Taking biotin can alter your bloodwork  to the point it can be indicative of a thyroid issue.  Be cautious.",femalehairadvice

"How to get a refund for melted hairMy little sister wanted to get her hair dyed so she asked our father to take her to a salon. He knows nothing about hair but everything about being cheap and prideful. So basically he took my sister to a shady salon that only accepted cash. Then, they proceeded to severely damage my sister's hair via bleaching it twice. It was her first time doing anything to her hair. She's just a shy high schooler so even at the end of the session when she saw it was not the color she wanted and extremely damaged, she couldn't say anything and got picked up by our father. He also didn't say anything to the hair stylist. This all happened while I was at work so I couldn't do anything about it.

I'm planning to go with my sister to the salon tomorrow to ask for a refund because her hair is literally falling off in clumps. My question is how do I go about this? I would like to be prepared for the hairstylists to offer to fix it (which we definitely do not want) or to offer a small amount for a refund. I'm not sure how much of a refund to ask for since I understand that they spent time and resources on her. It's just that what they did was a very big mistake. I'm not sure how to include a pic on this post but it's just awful looking...üòî Is it even possible to ask for a full refund? Sorry this post is long and all over the place, I'm just very upset about what my sister went through. Any help is appreciated‚ô•Ô∏è

Edit: Pics of my sister's hairüò∞üò∞üò∞
http://imgur.com/gallery/uls1r1y

Final edit: So today I politely explained to the hair stylist that the damage was just too much and I would need a refund. They were extremely accommodating and we agreed on giving me back $75 out of the original $150. They even gave us hair treatment! The hair stylist understood their mistake and owned up to it so I'm happy with the outcome. It turned out better than expected since I was ready for them to fight me lol. I did suggest to them though that they should make sure all their licenses and business practices check out.

Thank you to all the commenters who gave amazing advice and kind words‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è. It was a really stressful situation to handle but I somehow got through it with all your help. Wishing you all good hair days/ situations lol~",femalehairadvice

"Castor oil made my fine and straight hair wavyHi everyone!! I've lurked here for a while and love all the information because I am useless with hair. I recently  used castor oil on my very fine straight hair and it gave me really nice waves for the first time so I thought I would share my experience in case it helped anyone!

I have very fine hair. It's generally straight but can get a little wavy in  certain circumstances. I've never been able to control the wave though I've tried the curly girl method and experimented with all sorts of products. My hair tends to be dry and frizzy but most products to control the frizz are way too heavy and make my hair greasy. Even leave-in conditioner is not really an option. I recently used castor oil on my hair and got nice waves for the first time! Picture is below.

I bought B. Well Organic and Cold-Pressed 100% Castor Oil. I put it on wet hair before shampoo and conditioner. I let it sit for 5-10 min and then shampooed and conditioned as normal. I didn't have any expectations so I just slept on wet hair, but  I woke up with nice waves. I'm on day two now and my hair doesn't look greasy yet so I'm calling this a win.

"Please impart your hair wisdom on a pretty non feminine girl going through that kind of crisis where you just need a new hairstyleYeah that's pretty much it. I have 0 idea how to do my hair. Don't know how to braid it, curl it, do different hairstyles, use bobby pins - I literally know how to wash it, how to put in a ponytail, and how to put it in a bun. But I LOVE my long hair. I love that it has just enough curl to it when it air dries that I can wear it down without straightening it. But right now, I'm just not able to take care of it well enough for it to be this long (yay depression and thyroid disorder ‚úåÔ∏è)

So I really need some hairstyle suggestions. I don't generally like very short hair styles, or even shoulder length hair for myself but maybe there's one out there. It does have to be very low maintenance in terms of daily styling - I'm that person that wakes up 15 minutes before they need to be at work 7 minutes away. Right now I can just redo my bun from the day before or leave it down which generally doesn't look bad after sleeping on it. A color change would be great too, but either easy to maintain at home or doesn't look bad when my roots grow out. I spend too much money on my dogs for frequent salon trips and I am totally not trying this at home. 

Other relevant hair info: I think my hair is pretty thin and not very dense. I do think I take pretty good care of it and it's healthy - use volumizing shampoo and regular conditioner - only problem is a bit of a dry scalp. The only very short hair style I've seen and liked is an undercut, but can't stand the idea of growing such short hair when I want it long again (seriously can't stand shoulder length hair on myself - my mother traumatized me üòÇ) and not sure if an undercut in only the back is a good idea for thin and not very dense hair?

"Salon cut ALL my hair off and refuses to refund $200My hair grows pretty slow, exactly a year ago today (funny enough) I had to shave my head and then spent the next year growing out my hair until yesterday, now I had to shave it all over again because the hairstylist I trusted with my hair (I even told her how important it was to me and that I was nervous) COMPLETELY CHOPPED IT OFF.

Her manager said no refunds are allowed and they want me to ‚Äúcome in for a fix‚Äù instead but there‚Äôs literally no hair left to fix and what is left is totally fried. (Also this ‚Äúpolicy‚Äù was never specified anywhere, not even on their site) I‚Äôm so distraught. I ended up having to spend TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS and I‚Äôm still sobbing writing this after having to shave my head due to the bleach damage. Is there anything I can do??? This is ridiculous she totally chopped all my hair off I at least want my money back so I can get a nice wig :( 

TLDR: hairstylist charged me $200 and ended up chopping all my hair off and frying what is left, salon refuses to refund. What can I do?

"Should I shave my head?Hello everyone!

I‚Äôm 21F and I have never done much to my hair throughout my life. Twice I cut it shoulder length and those were my BIG CHANGES which I hated when outgrowing between shoulder and chest because it did not have any shape whatsoever, other than that I have it under the boob length most of the time. 

For the past 2 years I‚Äôve been considering shaving my head. I hate societal norms that give too much value to something as stupid as hair, specially on women. Also to be honest I‚Äôm incredibly attached to my hair and most of my confidence comes from it, I hate that so much. That‚Äôs one of the main reasons I think I should do it, also you only live once, it‚Äôs an experience, owning it and gaining confidence, hair Always grows back and all the pros. 

At the beginning of quarantine I considered it harder since everyone was doing it and I didn‚Äôt have to go out but my mother convinced me not to, so for the first time ever I kind of dyed it a balayage style which I liked.

Now I kinda regret it because if I had done it it would have grown a lot since then and lately these days I‚Äôve been considering it A LOT. I talked to my hairdresser and he was totally supportive and told me since I am latin, I should shave and dye it platinum blonde which sounds awesome. 
Recently I don‚Äôt like my hair, it has been a mess and I think I‚Äôm at a moment In my life where it‚Äôs the perfect time to do this and I really need to improve my confidence because of mental health issues. I‚Äôm just very scared of regretting it, looking ugly or looking unprofessional since I am in law school.

"Please help a trans woman out, first to at the salon tomorrow\*EDIT: Excuse the typo in the title\*

Hi Ladies,

I'm hoping you can offer some advice, tomorrow I'm off to the salon for the first time since transitioning. I have been growing out my hair for about 2 years and were a wig daily.

I spoke with the salon briefly last week as I wanted to get hair extensions, but first they wanted me to come in do to a colour since I currently have brown hair and want to blonde.

What information do I need to go prepare with tomorrow other then the colour and style of cut I'm after? I know this sounds so silly, but I don't want to miss anything.

My other question is when I brought my wig I fell in love with ash blonde hair, this is colour I plan to get, but I also would like blunt bangs (to hide my forehead). I can't seem to find any photos on the internet though with ash blonde and blunt bangs, does this mean these don't really look good together?

Sorry if this post is a bit all over the place.

Thanks",femalehairadvice

"Extreme Hair Thinning in 18 Y.O. FemaleHi all, I don't really post on reddit but I am at my wits end and am hoping for any advice I can get. I'm gonna try to put all of my information down so that the full story is told, and hopefully there will be other people in my situation and those that can help.

Growing up, I had regular thickness hair. I have always had pin straight hair. My hair grew quickly and was always silky soft. It was one of my favorite attributes and something that I had always been complemented on the most. It was probably two years ago once I started noticing something was up. The crown of my head became pretty apparent, I noticed one day and since then it's been downhill. There was no moment of ""Oh sh\*t, I have like no hair."" It was pretty gradual. Since then I've noticed the crazy amounts of hair in my brush and I just seem to shed like crazy. My hair is everywhere all the time. Even my hairdresser made (non-stop and rude may I add) comments about the thinness, comparing it to her friends (who was 50 something). Something that I have noticed that might be of some importance is that when a strand of hair is pulled at, it comes out pretty easily, and the follicle is very very small. Almost non-existant. This is compared to my eyebrow or other hairs on my body that have long thick follicles when I pluck them. I don't know the implications of this but it seemed note-worthy to mention.

Since I have noticed I have tried many things to stop and reverse this. I have tried brushing my hair less often, brushing it more often, scalp massaging, hair gummies and vitamins, all kinds of thickening products, and seeing my dermatologist. My derm ended up just telling me it was genetic, which was heart breaking to hear since that means there's no ""fix"". My mom does have very thin hair, but she always tells me that it was never like that at my age. She is 46 and I am 18 and I would say we have the same hair thickness. My scalp is very visible especially from the front and top and at the crown. When my hair is parted it doesn't make a definitive line as it does in regular thickness hair. 

I have gotten blood work done for my thyroid and it all came back clear. In the past two years my diet has been kind of strange seeing as I am a college student who eats what she can, but I always eat enough and healthily, and don't think its due to any kind of diet, restrictions, or anything like that. I am on anxiety medication but I have talked to my psychologist and she confirmed that none of my medications can result in hairloss. I drink enough water and get enough sleep, always have. I've never bleached, colored, or treated my hair in any way. Just cuts to maintain length. I do not think it is alopecia because it is a overall thinning in the hair on my head. No bald spots or round bald spots or nighter patches of hair. It could be **Diffuse Alopecia** but I don't know how to diagnose that. I don't pull my hair into tight buns, pony tails, or braids. I do not pull my own hair out (Trichotillomania). The only thing that I am worried about is that I have recently started birth control (Larissia) and I know that that can sometimes lead to hair loss (although I only started it last month and this has been occurring for the past two years, so I don't think that it caused it but I am worried it will make it worse.

I just don't know what to do. It is absolutely ruining my self image and self confidence. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Even in ponytails it's painfully thin. Something that was once my favorite thing about me has turned into the reason I cry when I look at myself. I feel so helpless in this situation. It feels like I can't do anything while I sit here and watch my hair continue to thin. I'm so young, this shouldn't be an issue. 

I'm so sorry this is long, but I felt like I needed to tell the full story. If anyone has any tips, advice, products, medication to recommend, or even just words of encouragement I would be very appreciative. I am so tired of this. Thanks for reading my hair manifesto.

Thank you all very much! &lt;3",femalehairadvice

"As a man, how can I learn to do women's hair?Hey everyone, my question is basically in the title. 

I won't bore you with the details, but TLDR, I'm a single dad who has been blessed with two beautiful daughters. I take them them things and often see other girls their age with all these intricate looking braids and hair styles that, I'm assuming, their mothers did for them. Well, that's not an option for my girls but I don't want them to feel left out. So I'm trying to learn how to all of that stuff myself. Are there any good resources you would recommend?


And also, just to practice, I certainly can't practice on myself and I doubt either of my daughters would be ok with sitting still for hours on end while their dad fumbles around with their hair. Not even to speak of me accidentally hurting them while I don't know what I'm doing. I found these hair stylist training mannequins online, but they all have these creepy faces on them and I really don't want the disembodied head of a plastic woman laying around my house. Any tips here?
