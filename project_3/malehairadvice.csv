"'How to ask the barber for...' Coming from a barberI see a lot of questions asking, how to ask the barber for a certain cut. 

Just show the picture, simple as that.

Not every cut has a specific name and you can rarely describe the cut to your barber, so they will know exactly what you want. 
Sometimes you may even misunderstand what you're looking at and tell the barber to give you something completely different.

To avoid all the confusion and anxiety, just show the picture. It's normal, common and makes the work for your barber MUCH easier.
We just look at the picture, know EXACTLY what you want and how to do it and then we can give your our feedback (how it'll look on you, our suggestions etc.)

Tldr; show the picture

"How to Style Men's Hair 

The average man tends to lack general hair styling knowledge, since it isn‚Äôt plainly or cohesively explained very often. This manuscript serves as a simple, comprehensive guide for the average man to consistently, quickly, and easily have salon-quality hair on a daily basis. This guide is organized into three subcategories for your convenience.

* Disclaimer: For whatever reasons, some guys seem to think it‚Äôs *gay* or *effeminate* to condition and maintain your hair. It‚Äôs not.

**SHOWER**

The distinctive qualities of stylish hair are the form and texture. Showering with the right products provides the base for a good style.

1 Use *volumizing* or *thickening* shampoos

* Look for shampoos that contain **biotin** or **collagen**. Most reliable products contain these ingredients because they are responsible for providing cell structure, which for our purposes means thick, dense, and healthy hair.
* Don‚Äôt use shampoo *every* day. Shampoos by design are meant to strip oils, grime, dirt, and other impurities from the scalp. But hair is meant to have certain healthy oils to keep the follicle and shaft lubricated, hydrated, and nourished. Overuse of shampoo dries out the scalp, starving it of these essential components. Use shampoo only when your hair appears greasy or if you haven‚Äôt used it a handful of days.

2 Conditioner is optional

* Use a conditioner if your hair is dry. Conditioners by design are meant to hydrate hair, providing sheen with a soft, luscious quality.
* Don‚Äôt use a conditioner if your hair is fine, thin, limp, or oily. Conditioners will make greasy hair greasier. Most conditioners are heavy in a sense that they weigh down hair. This makes limp hair appear even more flat. Hair that‚Äôs heavy from conditioners is also hard to style effectively.
* Look for a *weightless* and volumizing conditioner if you decide to use one. Use a small amount of conditioner, about a dime sized amount. Apply conditioner to the shaft of the hair, but not the roots. This helps prevent weighing hair down.
* Conditioner affects your hair aesthetically in different ways depending on how much you use and the quality of your hair. So experiment with it to find the best results, which could come from using none at all.

**DRYING**

The most vital factor to having excellent salon-quality hair that *keeps its hold* is how you dry it. The key to **ALL** salon-quality hairstyles is a combination of heat, water, and direction. Hair will stay in the direction it's dried if you comb it as you dry it. The heat from a blow dryer will perforate the shaft of the hair, making the filaments expand and the pores expand. This makes the hair retain the direction it‚Äôs combed and provides volume. Also, some people use a pre-styler before they dry their hair to give their hair distinctive features. 

1 Towel dry your hair until it‚Äôs damp but not dry.

2 Pre-styler (optional)

* Sea salt spray: Adds a distinct texture, due to the salts property of retaining moisture
* Argan oil: Provides a rich, deep, coppery shine and protects against heat from the dryer
* Coconut oil: hydrates, shines, and has a coconut scent
* Moroccan oil: hydrates, shines, and softens hair, as well as adding shine. Rich in **vitamins** and **antioxidants**

3 Comb your hair.

* Preferably, using a wide-tooth comb at first, then a fine tooth comb. Using a fine tooth comb first on wet hair before its general shape has been established can slightly damage hair due to the yanking motion from moving the heavy, wet hair so forcefully.
* Comb the top part of your hair back (slick back), to the side (comb-over), or a combination of these two. This creates volume, which is a very desirable feature in good hair.
* Comb the sides behind your ears or straight down against your head. Don‚Äôt generate volume on the sides.
* Comb the back flat against your head. Don‚Äôt generate volume in the back.

4 Use a hair dryer and a comb (or a **hair styler**) to dry your hair. **Comb it and dry it at the same time in the same direction.**

* Use medium heat
* Dry it in the direction that you combed it.
* Comb it as you dry it. (the most vital step)
* Dry your hair abiding by this technique until it is about 90% or 100% dry.

5 Dry and comb your hair again with the *cool* setting.

* The cool air contracts the pores. This ‚Äúlocks‚Äù your hair in place.

**PRODUCT**

If your hair has been dried correctly, your hair should have a definite shape with lots of volume on top. The hair should keep its hold reasonably well. Adding product is the final step to preserve how long your hair remains in this state. Products also exemplify your hair‚Äôs texture, shine, and shape.

1 Select a product

* Creams: flexible, looser substances that provide a more natural, loose, and messy hold without adding much shine.
* Gels: Keeps your hair stiff and shiny, but doesn‚Äôt add too much volume. Adding too much will make your hair *crunchy*
* Pomades: appears as either a heavy white cream based or hard, clear gel based. Pomades possess a higher hold that adds volume and often adds high shine
* Clays: Heavy, white, hard substance that adds volume with a *matte* finish

2 Emulsify the product

* In *Layman‚Äôs terms* that just means take a small amount and rub it into your hands until you can‚Äôt see it anymore
* This ensures even distribution and prevents clumps
* Use a dime or quarter sized amount

3 Apply product to hair

* Focus on the roots and sections with distinct partings. For example, if you have a comb over, focus most of the product on the actual part where the hair flips over
* Add some under your bangs and go up
* Emulsify more and repeat for each section of your hair
* Don‚Äôt put much on the sides and back. Wipe off excess products there instead.
* Push the sides and back flat against your head with the product

4 Comb the hair again after the product is in your hair

* Use your hands if you want a more *natural* look

In conclusion, these are the fundamentals of styling men‚Äôs hair that works with the vast majority of haircuts. Ideally, your haircut should be longer on the top, with *layers*, and *thinned out*, *tapered*, or *faded* at the back and sides to keep it proportional. Consult with your barber or stylist for the best looks. Also, although these steps may seem long and tedious, with practice you can achieve consistent, remarkable style in less than 10 minutes.

* An even quicker, more compact version of these methods is to just wet your hair, dry it using proper techniques, then add product.

* Check out [Alex Costa](https://youtu.be/-zlvkz9WDR8), [Alpha M](https://youtu.be/8irflrbt6k8), [Weston Boucher](https://youtu.be/LpQYUZEN5wk), and [Blu Maan](https://youtu.be/oVjXjvZKOrk) for excellent live examples to follow.",malehairadvice

Bad advice for hair lossCan we get this u/Hair2Bald guy removed from this subreddit please? He's being a massive dick to guys who are concerned about potential hairloss.

Always been intrigued by the idea of it but didn't know how it would actually look and feel.  With an active lifestyle with lots of sports and sweating, worrying about the performance and durability of the unit was also top of mind.

Anyway, here's the end result - what do you guys think?

BTW, if you're contemplating getting a hair piece or have any specific questions, then reach out to Aaron ([@\_shearperfection](https://www.instagram.com/_shearperfection/) on IG) since he's the barber who installed it and blended the natural hair with the unit.

"Multiple choice: why you shouldn‚Äôt show them a pictureAbout a million times a day somebody posts a picture of the hairstyle they want and asks this profound question: ‚ÄúHow do I describe this to my barber?‚Äù

This begs the question: Why is it ok to show the picture to everyone here, but somehow it‚Äôs not ok to show it to the person who is **trained** and **earns a living** by cutting and styling hair? I mean really, help me understand. 

The reason it‚Äôs not cool to show the picture is:

a) Only people on here can understand a picture, a hair care professional is too dumb to know what they‚Äôre looking at.

b) The people on this sub are so brilliant that they can describe what salt tastes like to such a  degree that an alien would immediately know what salt is and what it tastes like.

c) Mind reading is a required course at cosmetology school and the barber must pass it in order to get their professional license.

d) Showing the person who‚Äôs going to sculpt your hair a picture, and saying that you want this style, is somehow going to insult their intelligence.

e) Showing a picture of another dude whose hairstyle you like will make it look like you‚Äôre gay (but somehow showing it here doesn‚Äôt). Hint: nobody cares.

The correct is f) None of the above. This is a trick question, there is no valid reason for not taking along a visual.

"Why asking 'how to ask for'/ 'what is this called' doesn't help?Not every cut has a name and every batber has a different interpretation of what a certain cut looks like. 
You could have 2 ideantical twins as models and 2 barbers that get the same description and you'll get 2 different cuts.

Pretentious as it may sound, cutting hair is a lot like sculpting. Every barber will have a different idea of what will work and imagines each part of the description a bit differently.

The best bet to get what you want is to show the picture, so the barber knows EXACTLY what you want.

And even then don't expect to look like the picture, because you don't have the same face shape, head shape, hair texutre etc. etc. as the model in the picture.

Be sure to TALK with your barber aswell. Get to know their process and if you don't know what the barber's asking, let them know. 

And in the end, if you and your barber just don't click and it doesn't work, not matter what, CHANGE the barber!

"Beware the haircut fetishists!I've talked to someone on the subreddit once before about this who's noticed these people too. As someone who has experience with that community, I see an alarming amount of users on this subreddit telling men here to shave their heads or get a short haircut or something because they get off on it and they hide it as advice.

Now, I am not kink-shaming or anything and I am completely fine with people jerking off to men getting short haircuts, but the problem is that often men who are asking for advice for their hair get these non-genuine comments (obviously, it's fine if people actually think a short haircut would suit a man, but there's a lot of people who consistenly insist on a short haircut for every man, most probably because they get off on it).

These people usually have usernames containing the words buzz, hair, bald, head, shave, slick... Their comments get very downvoted and a quick look at their profile will show that they have a very consistent pattern to their comments.

1) You couldn't explain what you wanted. ""I don't know what it's called, but kind of short here, and kind of long here"". Or worse still ""shorter"". Keep in mind reading this tone doesn't come across on the internet, I'd usually have them laughing with me as we went along, but my pat response was to gently but amusingly say ""thank you sir for eliminating cutting it **longer** as an option"" and then if they still just said ""shorter"" I'd set up a balding clipper and say ""well this will take it right down to the skin, give you your money's worth"" and then they'd go ""no, no! Like you know, this (measures hair) long"". And then we'd laugh and he'd realize I'm not psychic and we'd talk a bit more and then I'd have a good idea, and I'd get a verbal ""yes that's it"" before starting. Take a picture if you've got one, preferably one that has a photo of the sides and the back somehow, a 3/4 is perfect.

2) Your head shape, face shape, etc. was not appropriate for the haircut. A good barber will stop you if what you're asking for will somehow not work and talk you through your options. If your hair has a growth pattern that will make what you ask for stick up like an angry porcupine at the back, or you have really curly hair and ask to look like Billy Idol - or the haircut you bring in has hair longer than yours - it's not going to work or at least not work without a lot of effort, chemical preparation and flat ironing you're not going to do the next day I promise. 

And a good barber will actually suggest something similar but not exact. At the end of the day if you insist on cutting exactly way X, you'll get what you ask for, but it might not look on you like you think. Discretion is a HUGE part of what you do as a barber - you have to try and capture the essence of what's being asked for with the specific growth pattern, length and thickness of hair the client actually has.

If you ask for the impossible or weird, like for a combover to look like you have naturally growing hair, you're going to be disappointed. I wasn't working there but as a youth I saw a man actually greatly vituperate a woman because he thought doing a double crossover weave (back of head forward, from the right ear over the head) combined with a perm to volumize the hair would make him look like he wasn't bald. It couldn't. It didn't. 

3) Your barber is crap, and won't admit it. Different barbers have different strengths. I could fade okay, but if some dude came in who wanted it absolutely flawless, I'd toss the job over to a guy who worked for the military for years who could fade hair blindfolded. A great guy is one who will say ""I'm not as good at that, that guy there is"" and wave you on as a client. By the way, the military dude knew I was good at classic and vintage haircuts and sent people my way that wanted to look rockabilly or 40s. There's a good team going in a good shop, with different people good at different things. 

4) Your barber fucked something up and compensated for it by going a different direction. In five years, I only ever put the wrong blade on ONCE. ONCE. I was the kind of dude who would look at the blade, put the blade on, look at the blade AGAIN, and THEN start cutting. If you interrupted me in that process, I'd look again. But it can and does happen, people are human. There is NOTHING worse than starting a low skin fade and having to go to a high and tight because you snapped a 0 in when you thought you had a 3.

5) You micromanaged the haircut. Telling a barber what you want is one thing. Constantly staring in the mirror and saying ""go shorter here, use the next blade down, etc."" is not helpful. But be assertive. If it doesn't look right, say so and most barbers will happily oblige. But there's a difference between explaining what you want and telling someone how to do their job. Many barbers by the way err on the side of going too long so they can do it again, rather than too short and say ""well, it'll grow out.""

6) Your barber has no passion for his work anymore and is just marking time. Or is distracted with a game on TV, or being on the phone to someone while cutting. I find it the absolute nadir of disrespect to carry on any kind of phone conversation, or an extended conversation with anyone other than the client. Chatting with a willing client is fine, talking to your friends about the game on your phone while saying ""I can do this and that at the same time"" is another.

7) You went to a chain store where they mandate unless a client comes in with very specific requests e.g. a shaved head or a mohawk that you cannot pass off ""the company cut"" with, everyone gets ""the company cut"" which is what some time and motion man figured out would take the least time. You know you're in a spot like this when every single person working there starts their cuts exactly the same way, at the same spot, and the whole game is about turnover. They're making their money by figuring they'll have to refund $X amount of people, there's a smaller subset who will not be happy but shrug and not make a fuss, and most people simply won't care, the haircut was $8.

8) You pictured that haircut as working on you differently to what it would. See #2. The haircut was done exactly how you wanted and your hair pattern and texture worked for it, but it just didn't suit your face.

What do I do with my hair?,malehairadvice
"Did a short buzz cut after having the same, long-ish haircut for years. What do you think?I did this because my hair is thinning and hair line receeding, meaning the fringe got greasy/sweaty easily and just didn't look as good as it did before (wind would really fuck me over).

If you want to see my previous past with examples of hair from the last year (and my covid-19 lockdown hair from a few days ago) [then check out my previous thread here](https://old.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice/comments/ha97ub/26_years_old_thinningreceeding_hair_getting_worse/).

ANYWAY, the buzz cut. I went with a number 2, I did think of going down to a number 1 (2 was longer than I expected it to be) but ultimately stuck with 2 at least for now.

**BEFORE:** [Here is how my hair looked today just before the buzz cut](https://i.imgur.com/zGknz5l.jpg) with a bit of helmet hair from riding my motorcycle there (which I think always improved the look of the hair since it would better stay down/to the side like a better behaving fringe).

**AFTER:** [with DIY buzzcut done, using number 2 guard as I said.](https://i.imgur.com/b6XOeat.jpg)

I'd like to hear what people think of this, how it suits me, whether I should go with longer hair or stick with this as it is now, etc. Just generally want to hear what you think! Again, if you want more context then you can check my other post that I linked above.
