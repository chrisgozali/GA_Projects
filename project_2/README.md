# Project 2 - Ames Housing Dataset
# Executive Summary

Abc network intends to launch a new docu-series on property flipping called "house hunters". The show's target audience is Americans who are passionate about transforming homes and reselling them at a profit. Its unique selling point is taking a data driven approach to property flipping. The first season of the series will feature houses in Ames, Iowa. I have been hired as a data scientist to  then idenfity features that are the best predictors of sale prices.

By analysing the housing dataset from Ames, Iowa Assessorâ€™s Office containing individual property sales from 2006 - 2010, I have created a predictive model using linear regression with Ridge regularization.  A baseline model describing the average sale price of the entire dataset was used as a benchmark to beat when building the model. To verify that our model works well, we have been provided with a test sample with similar features to the dataset to test on kaggle.

This analyses is split in two parts. The first part is for exploratory data anlysis and the second part for model construction and regularization.

The model includes a total of 1 features:
- 4 continuous
- 3 nominal
- 3 discrete
- 2 ordinal
- 2 polynomial

## Problem Statement

The primary stakeholders of this analyses is the team in charge of "house hunters" at abc and the secondary stakeholders are American TV viewers who are keen on property flipping. Hence the analyses aims to deconstruct the dataset into digestible information and reduce the features to handful which most strongly predict sale prices, while uncovering interesting relationships between features and sale prices which would help in developing strategies for property flipping.
